# Undergrad-DS-Projects

These are the relevant projects, assignments, and labs that I worked on while in the undergraduate Data Science courses at the University of Texas at Arlington. 

Many projects in this repository involve using predictive machine learning algorithms. Some projects display the advance understanding of using python and R.  


# The most significant projects to check out include:

**NLP Sentiment Analysis:**  
This was the very first instance of using machine learning in class. Was done using a bert deep learning nlp model.  

**Classification Customer Satisfaction:**  
A more thorough approach to machine learning with data EDA, data visualization, data cleaning and preparation, and using logistic regression and decision tree machine learning algorithms to complete the task of predicting customer satisfaction. The task was a binary classification task. 

**Regression House Price Prediction and Classification Churn Prediction:**  
Through a group collaboration in a DataMining and Management class, these two projects displays thorough data EDA, data visualization, data cleaning and preparation, data transformations, machine learning algorithms relevant to the type of task, and data visualization of performance metrics.  

**Biology Research**  
Through the collaboration with a fellow data science + biology student, data analysis was done in R on the findings of our experiment on the grouping anti-predator behavior of Killifish in a research class.
